My name is Jinying (Rowling) Luo. I grew up in Zhejiang China, pursued bachelor degree at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), majoring in Statistics. I am currently an LBS student studying Analytics and Management. After graduation, I intend to work in Investment Banking in Hong Kong or London.

My interests include:

1. Eating. Hope to eat the most delicious food all over the world.
2. Rock climbing. I enjoy exciting sports to push my envelope and boost my sense of control and confidence
3. Swimming. My hometown consists of thousands of islands. So, I lived nearby the sea.
4. Travelling. If you have travelling plan in Europe, please call me!!

Five things in my life:

1. Over the years I keep the habit of weighing myself on the scales everyday so as to control my diet and monitor my training effect.

2. My hometown Zhoushan is one of the four Buddhist sites. We seek the blessing of the Buddha whenever something important comes. This belief can relieve my anxiety to some extent.
 
3. During college I paid much attention to the convenience of the blind’s lives. Then I led students in the welfare association to organize a “Blind Experience Workshop” to experience the life of the blind for one day, which became one of our association’s brand activities.
 
4. I once served as a volunteer English teacher in Thailand two years ago. Before I came back to China, a child wrote “Thank you” in Thai on the floor. It was truly memorable and taught me to express gratitude to those who have offered help.

5. I am a lucky girl. I often get the first prize like segway and Dyson vacuum cleaner in lucky draw.
